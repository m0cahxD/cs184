Our projects runs on windows on visual studio. We start the animation by just going to the local debugger and pressing run.
There are no arguments that need passing.

Extra Credit:

Demonstrated a solution with different joints and different joint lengths (original was 4 joints, EC has 5 joints)

Demonstrated a solution with a pin wheel joint (Joint 0, the joint connected to the base. We choose to do this one the base
joint because on our first try, we tried with an arbitrary joint in the middle of the arm and it was very hard to see, 
regardless of loop, the point joint working. Using the base joint, you'll notice while joint 1 rotates along x and y axis
a lot, the base joint only ever rotates on the z axis)

Solved multiple constraints? (I'm not sure if this means we sastified mutliple EC requirements at once but that's what we did)
